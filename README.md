<h1 align="left">Hey there, I'm Jay.</h1>

I like taking things apart to see how they work. Whether it’s software or hardware. Most of my work leans toward reverse engineering, binaries, and low-level systems, but I’ve also spent time with web dev, embedded programming, and hardware tinkering. An insatiable curiosity keeps me moving across layers of tech.
